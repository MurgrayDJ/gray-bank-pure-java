## About
Technologies used include SQL, JSPs, Servlets, and Session Tokens.

Currently hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, attached to an AWS RDS instance.

This project is meant to be a snapshot of my skills at that time, which is why I haven't made any changes to improve it.

The repository "Gray Bank" is meant to be a redo of this project using Spring. 

## Features
This application allows you to:
- Create a user account
- Login
- Create bank accounts (Checking, Savings, Credit)
- Complete transactions (Withdraw or deposit money)
- View account statements (list of previous transactions and current balance)
